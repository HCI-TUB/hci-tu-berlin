"workshopGoals": {
  "text": "Building on prior work in HCI field research [7], this workshop moves beyond conceptual debates to focus on practical strategies for integrating field studies in the future of collaborative work in hybrid spaces.",
  "bullets": [
    "Assess the current state of field research in HCI with the workshop participants – particularly within Germany and the EU. Based on their experience and the case studies that they have submitted, participants will review the scope, frequency, and impact of field studies while identifying the methodological, regulatory, and funding constraints that have hindered their adoption.",
    "Identify methodological advances that facilitate efficient field studies. Participants will exchange insights on effective tools, study designs, and workflows that enable a transition from controlled experiments to real-world deployments. Kjeldskov et al.[7] discuss that the HCI community needs to find ways to move earlier into the field. We want to build upon their discussion and explore within this workshop how far we have come and more critically reflect on why the move to the field is happening slower than we envision at the start of projects. We are specifically interested in case studies from practitioners and researchers that failed or required multiple rounds of improvements. However, the discussion will also include examples of successful field research methodologies [6], as well as strategies for balancing scientific rigor with real-world constraints [11].",
    "Explore best practices for regulatory compliance and data-sharing. The discussion will focus on strategies for navigating legal and ethical requirements in field studies, particularly under the Forschungsdatenschutzgesetz/research data regulations [2]. Additionally, the workshop will examine how universities and research institutions can support standardized, legally compliant data collection and sharing early in the project in a timely manner.",
    "Address structural barriers in publishing and funding that discourage field studies. Participants will discuss how HCI publishing norms favor lab-based research, limiting incentives for longitudinal, real-world studies. This discussion will explore how we can address this as a community."
