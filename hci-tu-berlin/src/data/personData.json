      "description": "Ceenu George is a Professor at the Technical University of Berlin, where she leads the Chair for Human-Computer Interaction. From 2021 to 2023, she was a Senior Researcher at Google Munich, working in the Trust and Safety Research team. During this time, she also held a Visiting Professorship for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence at the University of Augsburg from September 2021 to September 2022. She completed her PhD (Dr. rer. nat.) at LMU Munich in 2020, focusing on Virtual Reality Interfaces for Seamless Interaction with the Physical Reality. Following her PhD, she worked as a Post-doctoral Researcher at LMU Munich. Before entering academia, she gained extensive industry experience as a Senior Digital Product Manager at PAYBACK – American Express, and in various roles as Digital Product Manager and UX Research Lead at American Express in London. She also held research and development positions at Goldman Sachs in London and at the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in Vienna. She holds an M.Sc. in Human-Centred Computer Systems from the University of Sussex and a B.Sc. in Computer Science with Business from the University of Bath.",

      "description": "My research focuses on understanding and preserving spatial knowledge acquisition within indoor navigation systems. I am particularly interested in the cognitive aspects of navigation and in designing technology that supports and enhances these cognitive processes, from an HCI perspective. The widespread adoption of route-guided navigation systems, such as GPS-based navigation, has led to a gradual decline in human spatial awareness. This issue is often overlooked by the developers of navigation technologies. My research addresses this gap by exploring two key areas: human cognition in navigation and the development of technology that preserves and supports cognitive processes. On the cognitive side, I investigate how humans acquire spatial knowledge in different environments, theorizing spatial knowledge acquisition through landmarks in indoor spaces and examining the intrinsic cognitive differences between indoor and outdoor navigation. From a technological perspective, I focus on developing precise localization methods for indoor navigation, utilizing both head-mounted displays (HMDs) and smartphones. I also explore the role of different modalities in navigation, including audio, speech, and haptics, as well as the visual, auditory, and haptic representation of landmarks to support spatial awareness.",
